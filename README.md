This is the GitHub page fpr my <Vector> Utils Discord bot

I like the idea of having my code open source, so that is why this bot is open source

Setup Instructions:

1. Clone/Download the repo, and import it into Visual Studio 2019
2. Create a config.json file in the main directory and in "bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1"
3. Paste the code below into the config.json files in both directorys

{
	"token": "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE"
	"prefix": "Whatever you want"
}

If the bot doesn't work, feel free to not contact me
